    WHAT ARE RAW SOCKETS?
    ---------------------
    Raw sockets give direct access to the network protocol layer, bypassing the 
    normal TCP/UDP socket interface. This allows creating custom packet structures,
    implementing custom protocols, and having more control over networking.
    
    This implementation adds port support on top of raw IP packets, which usually
    don't have port concepts (ports normally come from TCP/UDP).

          This is our custom port concept, not a standard OS port
        - protocol_id: The custom protocol ID to use (default: 200)
          IP protocol numbers are 8-bit values identifying the next level protocol
          Values below 143 are assigned to standard protocols (TCP=6, UDP=17)
          We use 200 as an unassigned protocol number for our custom protocol
